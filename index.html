        <h3>KIMI RAIKKONEN SAYS A VISOR TEAR-OFF STUCK IN HIS ALFA ROMEO FORMULA 1 CAR'S BRAKE DUCT FORCED A COMPROMISING EARLY PITSTOP IN THE 2019 SEASON OPENING AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX</h3>
            <p>Raikkonen ran ninth in the first stint, escaping a first corner brush of wheels with Lando Norris to slot in behind the two Haas cars and Nico Hulkenberg's Renault in the 'class B' battle.The Alfa was the first car to make an ordinary pitstop in the race, on the 12th of the 58 laps, but Raikkonen said it was a compromised strategy</p>
            <p>"I think we had a small brake cooling [problem]," he explained. "One of the tear-offs fell in so we had to stop earlier than we wanted."</p>
            <p>"The car had a lot of speed in my view, but it is still difficult to overtake here. It is easier to get closer but the last push is still tricky in this circuit."</p>
            <p>Although the early stop was unscheduled, Raikkonen did not lose any places to the cars he had been battling with.</p>
            <p>He ended up finishing close behind Hulkenberg in eighth place, holding off Lance Stroll's Racing Point, Daniil Kvyat's Toro Rosso and out-of-position Red Bull driver Pierre Gasly in a late five-car battle.</p>
            <p>Asked if the race was everything he had hoped for on his first outing with Alfa Romeo, Raikkonen replied: "Not all, but I think we will take it.I'm happy how the car felt but generally if we would have tidied up a few things we could have got more.</p>
            <p>"But for the first weekend with the team, I will take it.No major fuck ups - so we take it and try to make the car faster for the next one."</p>
            <p>Raikkonen's team-mate Antonio Giovinazzi finished 15th. Giovinazzi ran an extremely long first stint and held up a number of top-10 contenders who had stopped early as he lost pace on worn tyres, before rejoining well adrift of the main midfield pack when he eventually stopped.</p>

        <h3>VASSEUR ‘POSITIVE’ AFTER POINTS SCORING RETURN FOR ALFA ROMEO RACING</h3>
            <p>Frédéric Vasseur, the Team Principal of Alfa Romeo Racing, felt the season-opening Australian Grand Prix was just ‘okay’ after Kimi Räikkönen brought home his C38-Ferrari in eighth place to score four points.</p>
            <p>Räikkönen was forced to pit early after a visor tear-off lodged itself in his brakes but was still able to bring his car home inside the top ten amid the tight midfield battle, although team-mate Antonio Giovinazzi had a more testing day, suffering car damage on the opening lap after hitting debris from Daniel Ricciardo’s broken front wing and running an alternative strategy, a combination that ended with the Italian finishing down in fifteenth.</p>
            <p>Vasseur says the issues for both drivers were unforeseen but both drivers fought as hard as they could in the circumstances and to take home the four points from Albert Park is a positive start to the season, which he hopes can be improved on next time out in the Bahrain Grand Prix at the end of the month.</p>
            <p>“For the first race of the season, it was an okay race,” said Vasseur.  “We had some small issues which we could not have anticipated and both drivers put up a good fight."</p>
            <p>“We are returning home with 4 points, which is a positive. To start the season with one car in the top ten is a good achievement and we will push hard to score some more points at the next Grand Prix in Bahrain.”</p>

      <h3>KIMI RAIKKONEN WOULD LIKE TO ACHIEVE THE SAME SUCCESS HE HAD AT LOTUS WITH ALFA ROMEO.</h3>
            <p>The 2007 world champion enjoyed a successful two years with what is now the Renault team, winning the season finale in Abu Dhabi in 2012, followed by the Australian Grand Prix in 2013.</p>
            <p>Now, having left Ferrari to return to a progressing midfield team at the former Sauber outfit, the Finn believes one factor will be crucial.</p>
            <p>"I hope so," he told AutoMoto when asked about the Lotus comparison. "But I don't know what our competitiveness is. The order in the middle is very close."</p>
            <p>"It will also depend on who will make their car faster during the year. We will try to do a good job from the beginning and then go from there."</p>
            <p>Raikkonen's teammate Antonio Giovinazzi is also targeting a continuation of Alfa Romeo's momentum from 2018.</p>
            <p>"Last year they had a fantastic season," he said. "They started at the back but by the end of the year were always in the top 10."</p>
            <p>"We just have to start as they finished and then improve ourselves during the season, bringing home as many points as possible."</p>
